The approach involves utilizing the principles of least significant bit (LSB) manipulation, this project employs sophisticated algorithms to embed encoded messages within audio files without perceptibly altering the audible content. The approach involves identifying LSBs in audio samples and modifying them to encode information while preserving the integrity of the original audio. Additionally, the methodology includes decoding algorithms to extract concealed messages, ensuring accuracy and reliability in message retrieval. The Audio Steganography implementation successfully embeds and extracts hidden messages within audio files.
